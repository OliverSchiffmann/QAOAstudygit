# QAOAstudygit
repo for QAOA study the second

currently able to simulate optimsation for specific IBMQ backend, and able to get the circuit out of open qaoa into ibmq simulator. Remaining issue is getting the parameters given by the openQAOA to the local IBMQ simulator. Doing this would make tweaking the QAOA approach easier but perhaps not completley necessary.
